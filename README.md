# Gemini CLI LLM

## Description
Gemini CLI LLM is a command-line interface for interacting with the Gemini API to generate content using a local large language model (LLM). This project provides a simple way to leverage the capabilities of the Gemini API directly from your terminal.

## Installation Instructions
1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/gemini-cli.git
   cd gemini-cli
   ```
2. Set up a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
   ```
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```
3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. Replace the placeholder API key in `src/config/settings.py` with your actual Gemini API key.

## Usage
To use the CLI, run the following command in your terminal:
```
python src/main.py --input "Your input text here"
```
Make sure to replace `"Your input text here"` with the text you want to process. The API key must be set in `settings.py` for the CLI to function correctly.

## Project Structure
- `src/main.py`: The entry point of the CLI application. It handles command-line arguments, sets up the API request to the Gemini API, and processes the response.
- `src/utils/helpers.py`: Contains utility functions that assist with tasks such as formatting the API request and parsing the response from the Gemini API.
- `src/utils/agent.py`: Implements the GeminiAgent class that handles advanced features like context-aware prompting, conversation history, and text summarization.
- `src/config/settings.py`: Stores configuration settings, including the API key and any other necessary parameters for connecting to the Gemini API.
- `.gitignore`: Specifies files and directories that should be ignored by Git, such as sensitive information like API keys and virtual environment folders.
- `requirements.txt`: Lists the Python dependencies required for the project, including libraries for making HTTP requests and handling JSON data.
- `README.md`: Comprehensive documentation for the project, explaining its purpose, setup, usage instructions, and next steps for further development.

## Advanced Features

### Context-Aware Prompting
The CLI now supports context-aware prompting to get more precise responses:
```bash
python src/main.py --input "What are vectors?" --context "Machine learning concepts"
```

### Text Summarization
Summarize long texts using the summarization feature:
```bash
python src/main.py --input "Your long text here" --summarize
```

### Conversation History
The CLI maintains a history of interactions, including:
- Prompts
- Responses
- Timestamps

## Roadmap

1. **Add Unit Tests**
   - Write unit tests for utility functions and the main logic using `pytest` or `unittest`.
   - **Status:** 🚧 Under Development

2. **Improve Error Handling**
   - Add robust error handling for API timeouts, invalid API keys, and malformed responses.
   - **Status:** ❌ Not Started

3. **Support Multiple Commands**
   - Add commands like `--history` to view past token usage, `--reset` to clear logs, or `--config` to update the API key.
   - **Status:** ❌ Not Started

4. **Add Configuration Management**
   - Replace `settings.py` with a `.env` file and use `python-dotenv` for better security.
   - **Status:** ❌ Not Started

5. **Add Logging**
   - Use Python's `logging` module to log API requests, responses, and errors for debugging.
   - **Status:** ❌ Not Started

6. **Token Usage Analytics**
   - Parse the `token_usage.txt` file to calculate total tokens used over time and display usage statistics.
   - **Status:** ❌ Not Started

7. **Interactive Mode**
   - Add an interactive mode where users can input prompts continuously without restarting the script.
   - **Status:** ❌ Not Started

8. **Dockerize the Project**
   - Create a `Dockerfile` to containerize the application for easier deployment.
   - **Status:** ❌ Not Started

9. **Add a Web Interface**
   - Use Flask or FastAPI to create a web interface for the CLI.
   - **Status:** ❌ Not Started

10. **Integrate with Other APIs**
    - Extend the project to integrate with other APIs, such as summarization, translation, or sentiment analysis.
    - **Status:** ❌ Not Started

11. **Package as a Python Library**
    - Refactor the project into a Python package and add a `setup.py` file for distribution.
    - **Status:** ❌ Not Started

12. **Add Documentation**
    - Expand the `README.md` and use tools like Sphinx to generate detailed documentation.
   - **Status:** ❌ Not Started

13. **Optimize for Performance**
    - Add caching for repeated prompts using `functools.lru_cache` or a database like SQLite.
    - **Status:** ❌ Not Started

14. **Publish to GitHub**
    - Publish the project to GitHub, add a license, and encourage contributions from the open-source community.
   - **Status:** ❌ Not Started

## New Features Status
- ✅ Context-Aware Prompting
