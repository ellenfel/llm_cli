# Gemini CLI LLM

## Description
Gemini CLI LLM is a command-line interface for interacting with the Gemini API to generate content using a local large language model (LLM). This project provides a simple way to leverage the capabilities of the Gemini API directly from your terminal.

## Installation Instructions
1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/gemini-cli.git
   cd gemini-cli
   ```
2. Set up a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
   ```
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```
3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. Replace the placeholder API key in `src/config/settings.py` with your actual Gemini API key.

## Usage
To use the CLI, run the following command in your terminal:
```
python src/main.py --input "Your input text here"
```
Make sure to replace `"Your input text here"` with the text you want to process. The API key must be set in `settings.py` for the CLI to function correctly.

## Project Structure
- `src/main.py`: The entry point of the CLI application. It handles command-line arguments, sets up the API request to the Gemini API, and processes the response.
- `src/utils/helpers.py`: Contains utility functions that assist with tasks such as formatting the API request and parsing the response from the Gemini API.
- `src/config/settings.py`: Stores configuration settings, including the API key and any other necessary parameters for connecting to the Gemini API.
- `.gitignore`: Specifies files and directories that should be ignored by Git, such as sensitive information like API keys and virtual environment folders.
- `requirements.txt`: Lists the Python dependencies required for the project, including libraries for making HTTP requests and handling JSON data.
- `README.md`: Comprehensive documentation for the project, explaining its purpose, setup, usage instructions, and next steps for further development.

## Next Steps
1. Clone the repository.
2. Set up a virtual environment and install dependencies.
3. Replace the placeholder API key in `src/config/settings.py`.
4. Run the CLI using:
   ```
   python src/main.py
   ```
5. Explore extending the CLI with additional features or commands, such as adding more commands for different functionalities or improving error handling.
